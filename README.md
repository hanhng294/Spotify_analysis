- Visualizations and Analysis

## Task Description

This project is to build visualizations from Spotify's customer data. 
The report aims to gain insights into Spotifyâ€™s customer patterns and preferences, 
which could be valuable information for Spotify to further understand service performances and improve customer experience. 

## Data Sources
This data is taken from Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meeraajayakumar/spotify-user-behavior-dataset

The Spotify User Behavior Dataset is a comprehensive collection of anonymized data that offers valuable insights into the behavior patterns 
and preferences of Spotify users. The data covers customer demographic factors (age, gender), their behavior (usage period, device) and preference
(favorite genre, format, etc. for both podcast and music) as well as engagement metrics (subscription plan, ratings, etc.)

## Visualizations and analysis
For further understandings of Spotify users, I split the dashboard into 2 tabs: (1) User-Characteristics and (2) User-Preference. 
- Visualization: I use a combinations of charts (bar charts, pie charts, line charts, donut charts) as well as icons and summary metrics to
  capture customer behaviors, preferences and important metrics. 
- Analysis: all analysis and inferences are written in [*Spotify_report.pdf*](https://github.com/hanhng294/Spotify_analysis/blob/main/Spotify_report.pdf)
